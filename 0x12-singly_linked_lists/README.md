0x12. C - Singly linked lists
Linked List can be defined as collection of objects called nodes that are randomly stored in the memory.
Uses of Linked List
The list is not required to be contiguously present in the memory. The node can reside any where in the memory and linked together to make a list. This achieves optimized utilization of space.
list size is limited to the memory size and doesn't need to be declared in advance.
Empty node can not be present in the linked list.
We can store values of primitive types or objects in the singly linked list.
